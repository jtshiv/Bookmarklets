# Bookmarklets
 My collection of bookmarklets

## The Independent folder
These are the original scripts and are the ones designed to work by themselves

## bmlib.js
This script is where the other functions will eventually live. It pairs with a tampermonkey script ([https://github.com/jtshiv/Tampermonkey/blob/main/bookmarkLibrary.js]("https://github.com/jtshiv/Tampermonkey/blob/main/bookmarkLibrary.js")) I repurposed.
